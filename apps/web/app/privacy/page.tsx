              Atlas is a public-conversation search tool. Search terms and
              results are held in the page while you use it; the current search
              interface does not create an account, save a personal search
              history, or save research briefs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search requests are sent to the relevant public search provider.
              The Global Voices request is routed through an Atlas server
              endpoint; that endpoint applies a short-window, IP-keyed,
              best-effort rate limit. Hacker News, Bluesky, Lemmy, and Mastodon
              searches are sent from your browser to their public APIs. Forum
              excerpts are held transiently in the page; content-warning
              Mastodon posts are shown without a text preview. Those providers
              and Atlas&apos;s hosting infrastructure may process technical
              request data under their own terms and operational logging
              practices. Atlas does not control their retention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only when a visitor checks the optional AI box, Atlas sends the
              topic and up to 16 short public-source excerpts (without source
              URLs or author handles) to Groq for translation and summary.
              This feature requires a server-side Groq API key and uses the
              provider&apos;s Free tier; Atlas falls back to a local evidence
              overview if AI is not enabled or available. Groq says inference
              prompts are not retained by default but usage metadata is
              collected; see its <a className="underline text-ink" href="https://console.groq.com/docs/your-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">data handling documentation</a>.
              Groq processes prompts under its own terms. Never configure a paid plan or add
              payment details for this feature. Queries also go to the public
              sources listed on the Sources page. Avoid entering personal,
              confidential, or sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas does not intentionally persist your on-demand search terms
              or returned search results as a user search history. Search
              results are displayed temporarily and link back to their
              providers. Avoid entering personal, confidential, or sensitive
              information as a search query.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas also has server-side operational data services for
              scheduled collection and source monitoring. These are separate
              from the on-demand search page. Historical records may remain in
              the service database under its operational retention practices;
              the search UI does not let visitors create or manage those
              records. Current source and collection limitations are described
              in the <Link className="underline text-ink" href="/sources">source register</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas is hosted by Vercel and may use Supabase for server-side
              operational storage. Those services process information needed
              to deliver and secure the application. Server credentials are
              kept on the server and are not intentionally sent to the
              browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas does not claim that public posts represent a country,
              population, or market. Language and publication edition do not
              establish a contributor&apos;s location. See the{" "}
              <Link className="underline text-ink" href="/methodology">methodology</Link> for
              interpretation limits.
