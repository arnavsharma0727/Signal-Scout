              Atlas is a public-conversation search tool. Search terms and
              results are held in the page while you use it; the current search
              interface does not create an account, save a personal search
              history, or save research briefs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search requests are sent to the relevant public search provider.
              The Global Voices request is routed through an Atlas server
              endpoint; that endpoint applies a short-window rate limit using
              request network information. Hacker News, Stack Exchange, Lemmy,
              and optional Bluesky searches are sent from your browser to their
              providers. Bluesky excerpts are held transiently in the page and
              provider-labeled posts are shown without a text preview. Those
              providers and Atlas&apos;s hosting infrastructure may process
              technical request data under their own terms and operational
              logging practices. Atlas does not control their retention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas does not intentionally persist your on-demand search terms
              or returned search results as a user search history. Search
              results are displayed temporarily and link back to their
              providers. Avoid entering personal, confidential, or sensitive
              information as a search query.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas also has server-side operational data services for
              scheduled collection and source monitoring. These are separate
              from the on-demand search page. Historical records may remain in
              the service database under its operational retention practices;
              the search UI does not let visitors create or manage those
              records. Current source and collection limitations are described
              in the <Link className="underline text-ink" href="/sources">source register</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas is hosted by Vercel and may use Supabase for server-side
              operational storage. Those services process information needed
              to deliver and secure the application. Server credentials are
              kept on the server and are not intentionally sent to the
              browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atlas does not claim that public posts represent a country,
              population, or market. Language and publication edition do not
              establish a contributor&apos;s location. See the{" "}
              <Link className="underline text-ink" href="/methodology">methodology</Link> for
              interpretation limits.
